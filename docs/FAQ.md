# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is EchoVeil?

EchoVeil is a zero-knowledge reputation protocol that allows users to prove their trustworthiness and credentials without revealing their identity or transaction history.

### How does it work?

Users generate zero-knowledge proofs that demonstrate they meet certain reputation requirements (e.g., score above a threshold) without disclosing their actual score or identity.

### What are the use cases?

- Anonymous airdrops for high-reputation users
- DAO voting without revealing identity
- Credit scoring for lending without KYC
- Reputation-gated access to exclusive communities
- Sybil-resistant reward distributions

### Which blockchains are supported?

EchoVeil is optimized for zkEVM chains:
- Polygon zkEVM
- zkSync Era
- Other EVM-compatible chains (with higher gas costs)

## Technical Questions

### What is a nullifier?

A nullifier is a unique identifier derived from your identity secret that prevents double-spending of proofs. Each nullifier can only be used once.

### How are reputation scores calculated?

Reputation scores are computed off-chain by aggregating on-chain activity data. The computation logic is transparent and auditable.

### What is a Merkle root?

A Merkle root is a cryptographic hash representing the entire reputation tree at a specific point in time. It's stored on-chain for verification.

### How long does proof generation take?

Typically 3-5 seconds on modern hardware. Proof verification on-chain costs approximately 250,000 gas.

### Can I update my reputation?

Reputation is updated periodically through epochs (typically daily). Your score is recalculated based on recent activity.

## Privacy & Security

### Is my identity truly private?

Yes. Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that nobody can link your proof to your wallet address or transaction history.

### What if I lose my identity secret?

Your identity secret is like a private key. If lost, you cannot generate proofs. Always back it up securely.

### Can someone forge my reputation?

No. The zero-knowledge proof system ensures proofs can only be generated by those who actually have the required reputation.

### What prevents Sybil attacks?

Nullifiers ensure each identity can only prove once per epoch, preventing fake accounts from claiming multiple times.

## Integration Questions

### How do I integrate EchoVeil into my dApp?

See our [Integration Guide](./INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### What are the gas costs?

- Proof verification: ~250,000 gas
- Identity registration: ~150,000 gas
- Nullifier consumption: ~45,000 gas

### Do I need to run my own oracle?

No. You can use the shared EchoVeil oracle. However, you can run your own for custom scoring logic.

### Can I customize reputation criteria?

Yes! You define your own requirements (min score, max score, epoch, etc.) when verifying proofs.

## User Questions

### How do I register an identity?

Use the EchoVeil SDK or web interface to generate an identity commitment and register it on-chain.

### Where is my reputation data stored?

Your actual reputation data is stored off-chain. Only the Merkle root is stored on-chain.

### How do I generate a proof?

Use the EchoVeil SDK with your identity secret and the current Merkle tree data.

### Can I have multiple identities?

Yes, but each wallet address can only register one identity at a time.

### What if I want to start over?

You can generate a new identity secret, but you'll lose your historical reputation associated with the old identity.

## Troubleshooting

### My proof verification is failing

- Ensure you're using the current Merkle root
- Check that your score meets the threshold
- Verify you haven't already used this nullifier
- Make sure your identity is registered

### Proof generation is taking too long

- Ensure you have sufficient system resources
- Try using a faster computer
- Consider using a proof-as-a-service provider

### Transaction is running out of gas

- Increase gas limit (proof verification requires ~250k gas)
- Deploy on L2 for lower costs
- Use batch verification for multiple proofs

## Economics

### Are there any fees?

- Gas fees for on-chain transactions
- No protocol fees currently
- Future: potential fees for premium features

### Can I earn rewards with reputation?

That depends on dApps you interact with. Many dApps offer rewards to high-reputation users.

## Governance

### Who controls the protocol?

The protocol is governed by a guardian multisig consisting of diverse, reputable entities.

### Can the protocol be upgraded?

Core contracts are immutable. Upgrades require deploying new contracts and coordinating migration.

### How are oracle updates managed?

Oracle updates have a timelock delay and cooldown period. Guardians can pause or override in emergencies.

## Future Plans

### What's on the roadmap?

- SBT (Soul-Bound Token) reputation mode
- Cross-chain reputation bridging
- zkTLS for Web2 credential import
- Anonymous DAO voting framework
- Reputation delegation/lending

### When is mainnet launch?

Currently in testnet. Mainnet launch planned after security audits are complete.

### Will there be a token?

Not currently planned, but may be considered for governance in the future.
